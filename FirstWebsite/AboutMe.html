		<p>
		Opening and closing tags, which are contained by less than and greater than signs, are used on either side of commands.
		</p>
	<h4><a name = "head"></a>Head</h4>
		<p>
		One such tag, called the 'head' tag, includes the browser information, such as website titles, which can be created with the 'title' tag. 
		</p>
	<h4><a name = "body"></a>Body</h4>
		<p>
		The body tag is another essential part of html programming and it includes the site content such as images and information.
		</p>
	<h4><a name = "format"></a>Formats</h4>
		<p>
		There are different ways to format paragraphs. To make separate paragraphs, the 'p' tag is used. To create a break between paragraphs, 'br' is used. To make a line, 'hr' is used. For bolding, 'Strong' is used. And for itallics, 'em' is used. 
		</p></hr>
	
	<h3><a name = "comments"></a>Comments</h3>
		<p>
		Comments can be added to programming with the use of greater than and less than signs and an exclamation mark. Links to other sites or pages can be added with anchor tags, noted as 'a', and hypertext reference, noted as 'href'.
	
		</p></hr>
		
	<h3><a name = "header"></a>Header</h3>
		<p>
		Headers are used to decide text size. There is a set system of fonts ranging from h1, the largest font size, to h6, the smallest font size. Text size is used to denote importance in the website. 
		</p></hr>
	<h4><a name = "hover"></a>Tool tips</h4>
		<p>
		To give more information about a link, a reader can hover over the link to generate a pop up tag, which can be coded in with 'title =' and the very general description of the link destination.
		</p></hr>
	<h4><a name = "images"></a>Image</h4>
		<p>
		To add images in a website, image tags are directed to an image with 'img scr = imagename.jpg'.
